         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A MEMORIAL Of His Excellency The Count D' Avaux, Ambaſſador Extraordinary from His Moſt Chriſtian Majeſty.</head>
            <p>Preſented to the States General of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Provinces on the 29th of <hi>April,</hi> 1684.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>Count D' Avaux,</hi> Ambaſſador, or Extraordinary from the Moſt Chriſtian King finds himſelf obliged, to ſatisfie the Orders he has received from the King his Maſter, to put your Lordſhips in mind, how that ſince <hi>Spain</hi> has declared War againſt <hi>France,</hi> and that His Majeſty could in no wiſe diſpence himſelf from Employing his Arms in the <hi>Low-Countrys,</hi> in order to the bringing that Crown to prefer the Re-eſtabliſhment of the Peace before the Continuation of the War, His Majeſty was willing at the ſame time to uſe all the Facilities that could reaſonably be expected from him, towards a ſpeedy Accommodation. Your Lordſhip too hath effectually ſeen, by the Memorial which the ſaid <hi>Count D' Avaux</hi> preſented to your Lordſhips in the Month of <hi>February</hi> laſt: He has moreover offered to your Lordſhips on the behalf of His Majeſty, all the Expedients the moſt capable of diſpoſing the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to conſent to this Truce, or at leaſt to remove the War out of the <hi>Low-Countrys;</hi> and there was ſo much the more appearance, that theſe Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents would produce all the good Effect which His Majeſty might promiſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from thence, and that they left you not any occaſion of uneaſineſs for the Barriere, and gave you the time neceſſary for the prevailing with the Catholick King, to conſent to the ſaid Truce, or to any Accommodations heretofore pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs the Intrigues and Sollicitations of the Miniſters of <hi>Spain,</hi> have ſtill had ſuch Power and Prevalency at the <hi>Hague,</hi> as not only to hinder your Lordſhips from Deliberating upon the late Offers of His Majeſty, but alſo to take the Reſolution of fortifying with all the Troups you had left, the refuſal of the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> inſomuch that it is at preſent in the power of thoſe who Command the ſaid Troups, to Engage by any Act of Hoſtility, all the United Provinces in a War againſt His Majeſty, and to break for ever the good Correſpondence which the Cities and Provinces, the moſt firm to the Antient and true Maxims of the Common-wealth believe it ſtill neceſſary to keep with <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This it is which determined His Maieſty to depart forthwith, to put himſelf at the Head of his Armys, and to make his way to a Peace by force of Arms, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had found all the means of Gentleneſs and Moderation ineffectual. But tho His Majeſty is entirely diſengaged from the Offers he made, by the Expiration of the time he had fix'd for the agreeing upon thoſe matters; and that he well knows he might Attaque Places whoſe Conqueſt might be more eaſie, and of a greater advantage to his Crown, than that of <hi>Luxemburgh;</hi> yet he has reſolv'd upon the Beſieging of that Town, as well becauſe it is entirely divided from all that ought to make up the Barriers of the <hi>Low-Countrys;</hi> and that it may not give any juſt occaſion of fear to thoſe who take Intereſt therein, as becauſe the Deſign which His Majeſty has of making himſelf Maſter thereof, tends rather to facilitating the Peace and Safety of his own Subjects, than the incommoding thoſe of the <hi>Catholick</hi> King, to whom this Place cannot be of any uſe: And moreover,
<pb facs="tcp:29765:2"/>His Majeſty already poſſeſſing all the Countries which ſurrounds it, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> are only wedded to the keeping it, out of the hopes they have it will ever furniſh them with the occaſions of renewing the Wars, and with the means of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more damage to <hi>France</hi> than any other in the Dominions of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick King. Yet as His Majeſty onely makes War with Intention of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding Peace upon Reaſonable Conditions, He declares by the ſaid <hi>Count d' Avaux,</hi> that if before the 20th of the month of <hi>May</hi> next, the Governour of the Low-Countries, whether upon his own motion, or the requeſt and ſollicita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of your Lordſhips, will effectually put into the power of His Majeſty, the ſaid City of <hi>Luxembourg,</hi> with 14 or 15 Villages and Hamlets which are of it's Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance; His Majeſty will not only conſent that the Cities of <hi>Dixmuyde,</hi> &amp; <hi>Courtray,</hi> after His Majeſty ſhall have caus'd their Walls, and Fortifications to be levil'd, ſhould be reſtor'd with their Dependancies to the <hi>Catholick</hi> King; but that he will alſo deſiſt from the demand he made of forty Villages, which were ſever'd by the Treaty of <hi>Nimeghen,</hi> from the Government of <hi>Tournay,</hi> and which have re-united to the Chaſteleny of <hi>Aeth;</hi> And that he will only detain of all the Places he has poſſeſs't himſelf of, ſince the 20th of <hi>Auguſt</hi> laſt, that if <hi>Beaumont,</hi> with three or four Villages which remain of it's Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dancy; <hi>Bouvines,</hi> which has not any, and <hi>Chimay,</hi> with twelve, or fifteen Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages which depend thereon; ſo as by the means of this Reciprocal Ciſſion, or Renunciation, namely, on the part of his Majeſty, all the Rights, and Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions upon <hi>Aloſt,</hi> the old Borough of <hi>Gaunt,</hi> and other Places demanded by his Procurator General, at the Conferences at <hi>Courtray,</hi> and all he has poſſeſs't ſince the 20th day of <hi>Auguſt</hi> laſt, bating the ſaid Places of <hi>Beaumont, Chimay, Bouvines,</hi> with the little which depend thereon; and on the behalf of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick</hi> King, as well the ſaid Places of <hi>Beaumont, Chimay, Bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>vines,</hi> and Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dancies; as the City of <hi>Luxemburg,</hi> and the Villages of it's Provoſty; the Peace may be Eſtabliſhed, and all ſorts of Occaſions of Diviſion removed, which might alter it in the future; Otherwiſe leaving <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> in the ſame ſtate of Poſſeſſion, in which they were at the raiſing of the Blockade of <hi>Luxem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg,</hi> without any pretenſion, being likely to be ſtarted on either part for any reaſon whatſoever. Thus his Majeſty has reaſon to believe, that if your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips have no other proſpect than the re-eſtabliſhment of the Peace with the Conſervation of the Barriers; or will oblige the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to guarrant them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by the ſpeedy acceptation of thoſe laſt Offers of his Majeſty, of all the Conſequences of the War, which cannot be to their advantage; or if the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick</hi> King has no regard to their Remonſtrances, His Majeſty expects, that your Lordſhips will take ſuch meaſures, as that your Troups may not come to any act of Hoſtility againſt his Majeſty.</p>
            <p>But as the ſincerity of his Intentions for the repoſe of <hi>Europe,</hi> has hitherto prompted him to open to you, the ways which may procure the Re-eſtabliſhment of the peace; if you continue to neglect them, and to keep ſo little meaſures with him, as to ſuffer your Troups to act at the pleaſure of the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> His Majeſty declares to you at this preſent, that upon the firſt act of Hoſtility, they ſhall commit upon his Troups bating in the fortified places, belonging to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick King, he ſhall think himſelf bound, (tho with grief, and unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs) to give immediately Orders for the ſeizing on all the ſhips, Merchandiſes, and Effects, which ſhall appertain unto their ſubjects, and conſider and treat you henceforward, as thoſe who foment and maintain with all their forces, the ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornneſs of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and who make War no leſs upon his Majeſty, than his declared Enemies.</p>
            <p>This his Majeſty has order'd the ſaid Count <hi>d' Avaux,</hi> to make known unto your Lordſhips, and to demand of you a poſitive Reſolution, at the fartheſt within fifteen days; which his Majeſty will expect, in the Head of his Armys: Now declaring, that time being expired, he pretends to be neither tied to any of the Propoſitions, he has heretofore made, nor to thoſe he makes at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</p>
